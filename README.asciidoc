== Elasticsearch Grails plugin https://github.com/grails-plugins/elasticsearch-grails-plugin/actions/workflows/gradle.yml[image:https://github.com/grails-plugins/elasticsearch-grails-plugin/actions/workflows/gradle.yml/badge.svg[!Java CI]]

https://grails-plugins.github.io/elasticsearch-grails-plugin/[documentation about the plugin]

=== How can I obtain the plugin?

Just like any other Grails plugin, through the Grails Plugin center.
Edit your project's +build.gradle+ file, by adding the plugin's dependency declaration:

+build.gradle+:
----
dependencies {
    ...
    compile "org.grails.plugins:elasticsearch:3.0.0-RC1"
    ...
}
----


=== Versioning

In order to simply the versioning, with v3.0.0.M1 the Elasticsearch Grails plugin is using Semantic Versioning 2.0.0. To understand what that means, please see the https://semver.org/[specification documentation]

=== Example Configuration for Grails 4

In the following we demonstrate two example configurations using Hibernate or MongoDB as a datastore.

==== Hibernate

Check out the https://github.com/puneetbehl/elasticsearch-demo-grails4[demo application] using hibernate and grails4.

Add the following to your +grails-app/conf/application.yml+:
----
elasticSearch:
    plugin:
        mapperAttachment:
            enabled: false
    client:
        mode: transport
        hosts:
        - {host: localhost, port: 9200}
    cluster.name: elasticsearch
    bulkIndexOnStartup: true
    datastoreImpl: hibernateDatastore
----

==== MongoDB

+build.gradle+:
----
dependencies {
  compile 'org.grails.plugins:mongodb:7.0.0'
}
----

+grails-app/conf/application.yml+:
----
elasticSearch:
    plugin:
        mapperAttachment:
            enabled: false
    client:
        mode: transport
        hosts:
        - {host: localhost, port: 9200}
    cluster.name: elasticsearch
    bulkIndexOnStartup: true
    datastoreImpl: mongoDatastore

==== NOTE

This project is a fork based on the great work done by the guys at:

* https://github.com/mstein/elasticsearch-grails-plugin
* https://github.com/noamt/elasticsearch-grails-plugin

==== Why would you want to fork the original Elasticsearch plugin?

The original Elasticsearch plugin relies on *Hibernate-specific* GORM components, thus rendering it unusable if you back your Grails application by any other database.
